# WikiConvert 📄➡️📝

Readme: [English](README.md)

**WikiConvert** is a robust tool developed in Python to convert **Microsoft Word (.docx, .doc)** documents to **Markdown (.md)** format. It is ideal for developers and technical writers who need to migrate offline documentation to Git repositories, blogs, or static documentation systems.

## ✨ Features

- **Text Extraction**: Converts Word paragraphs while preserving the basic plain text structure.
- **Image Management**: Automatically extracts inline or embedded images in the document, saving them as .png files.**
- **Smart Organization**: Creates a structured output directory with the formatted content and a dedicated folder for visual assets.
- **Debug Logs**: Integrated logging system to track progress and identify potential errors in complex documents.

## 🚀 How to Use

1 Installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sr00t3d/wikiconvert/
cd wikiconvert
```
2 Requirements: Install the `python-docx` library (required to read Word files):

```bash
pip install python-docx
```
3 Execution:

Place your `.docx` file in the script folder and run the converter:

```bash
python3 wikiconvert.py
```

## 📂 Output Structure

When converting a file, the script generates:

- A `.md` file with the processed content.
- An `/images` folder containing all figures extracted from the original document.
